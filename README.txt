FMC consists in recording full matrix of time domain signals from every transmitter-receiver pair. This matrix thus obtained is the basis of several post-processing technique such as total focusing method (TFM) beamformer which allows to focus the array in transmission and reception at every point in region of interest in material. FMC data acquisition technique combined with the TFM beamformer offer a new approach to the inspection of anisotropic inhomogeneous materials

This code is about full-matrix-capture data acquistition method with total focusing imaging algorihtm 

The class TFM is used to reconstruct the ultrasonic image

The data is coming from my experiment of FMC scanning on Austenitic cladding steel
